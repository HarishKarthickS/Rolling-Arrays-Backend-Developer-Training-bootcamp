# 🎉 3-Week Django Backend Dev Adventure @ Rolling Array Bootcamp 🚀

Welcome aboard the Django Express! 🚂💻 This repo chronicles the action-packed, brain-boosting, code-slinging saga of my **pre-joining bootcamp at Rolling Array**. We went from Python newbies to Django deployers in just 3 weeks — and had a blast doing it! Imagine a coding rollercoaster with plot twists, power-ups, and proud "it finally works!" moments. 🍿

## 📊 The Grand Blueprint
**Duration:** 3 Weeks  
**Schedule:** 6 Days/Week, 4 Hours/Day  
**Mission:** Conquer Django, launch two real-world projects, and flex those backend skills like a boss.

Every week upped the ante — more logic, more styling, more real-world magic. By the end, we weren’t just writing code… we were shipping products. 💥
